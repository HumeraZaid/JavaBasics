	     * What is type casting ?
	     * -- Type casting is converting one dataType into another dataType.
	     * Why should I learn about type casting?
	     * --  So that we can use the code that is written by someone else to make our life easier or when we will
	     * be working in teams, we will be able to merge the code.
	     * What is the syntax for type casting?
	     * -- When we are converting something smaller to larger, we don't need to do anything. It happens automatically.
	     * We just assign the variable. For example:
	     * int box=1234;
	     * long box2=box; // This is how it works and it is called implicit or widening or automatic conversion.
	     * However, when we convert larger dataType to a smaller dataType, then this is how we do it:
	     * long box=1245454;
	     * int box2=(int)box; // This is how it works and it is called explicit or narrowing or manual conversion.
