	Type casting:
		Type casting is converting one dataTypye into another dataType.We have two types of casting:
			1) Explicit/External/Narrowing/Manual:
			When we convert a larger dataType into a smaller one, it is called Explicit/External/Narrowing/Manual.
			
			2) Implicit/Internal/Widening/Automatic:
			When we convert a smaller dataType into a larger one, it is called Implicit/Internal/Widening/Automatic.
			
			-- byte(8)
			-- short (16)
			-- char(16)
			-- int(32)
			-- long(64)
			-- float (32)
			-- double (64)
	
			byte->short,char->int->long->float->double
	
	Why we need type casting?
		When we are working in teams, we might need to convert data from different dataTypes. When we are working with Math,
		sometimes, we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in the non-decimal part.
		
	What is the syntax for type casting?
		1) Explicit/External/Narrowing/Manual:
			int box=1000;
			byte box1=(byte)box;
			
		2) Implicit/Internal/Widening/Automatic
			 short box2=250;
			 int box3=box2;
